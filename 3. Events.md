# Events #
### Information about events ###
#### Events sending ####
Client's application sends statements (events) to the engine in JSON format through HTTP connection (REST API). HTTP connection sends statements in packages. Data encryption is done using the SSL protocol.
#### Multiple sources ####
Data can come from multiple sources (users, game servers). Events are distinguished with a *client_id* variable. The application is customizable for specific customers through defining dedicated metadata (variables, aggregates, models).
#### Events processing order ####
Events processing order may not be maintained. It is determined on the basis of event time saved in JSON.
#### Transforming events to variables ####
Transform rules are defined in metadata as rules in JSONPath. Variables will be defined by analytics or generated automatically by analysis of given sample of events and verified by analytics.
### Formats of JSONs containing events ###
#### Generic formats ####
For generic formats of JSONs, the Event Engine provides the most efficient processing.

###### Example of JSON: ######
```json
{"arrival_ts":1232344,  
 "client_id":1, 
 "user_id":5, 
 "event_id":23,
"eventType1":
[
{"eventA":{"value":10, "name":"AAA"},
 "value":"value1"
},
{"eventB":{"value":45, "name":"BBB"},
 "value":"value2" 		
}
			   ]
			}
```
###### Examples of variable expressions ######
```
$.['eventType1'].[0].['eventA'].['value']
``` 
returns 10

```
$.['eventType1'].[1].['value']
``` 
returns "value1"

###### Examples of queries containing additional conditions ######
In generic format of JSONs, queries containing additional conditions are also optimized. These conditions can check equality by "==" sign and can be connected by "&&" sign.

```
$.['eventType1'].[0].['eventA'].[?(@.['value'] == 10 && @.['name'] == "AAA")].value
```
 returns [10]

```
$.['eventType1'].[0].[?(@.['eventA'].['value'] == 10 && @.['eventA'].['name'] == "AAA")].value
```
 returns "value1"

```
$.[?(@.name == 'eventType1')].['type'].[0].[?(@.event == 'eventA')].['value']
```
 returns [10]

#### Other formats, compatible with JSONPath ####
These formats provides worse processing efficiency. An analytic must add rules defining the change from JSON format to a metadata variable (see [chapter 5](http://event-engine-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5.%20Metadata/)).

###### Example of JSON ######
```json
{"arrival_ts":1232344,  
 "client_id":1, 
 "user_id":5, 
 "event_id":23,
 "name":"eventType1",
 "type":
 	[
{"event":"eventA",
 	 	    "value":10
},
{"event":"eventB",
 	 	    "value":45
}
 	]
}
```

###### Example of variable expression ######
```
$.[?(@.name =~ /.*eve.*/i)].['type'].[1].['value']
```
returns [45]

### Responses ###
A statement with score is a direct response to the bid request.
The statement consists of scores for each impression:

- impid - id of the impression
- scores - a list of models and scores; empty, if none of models were scored  or none of deployed models are active. Otherwise the list contains elements, where id of the model is a key and suggested bidding price is a value.

```json
[
{
"impid": "424c6a8db16d4fa8ab853c5cd7b04ac7",
"scores": {
1314: 0.6930373068263596,
1315: 5.24522720421126,
1316: 44.87740531791001
}
},
{
"impid": "e5d26e91ac2441f997e3b1bee6168562",
"scores": {
1314: 0.6930373068263596,
1315: 5.24522720421126,
1316: 44.87740531791001
}
]
```

The price is calculated according to the formula: 

`min(10 * value, score * value * weight)`

- score - scoring result
- value - value of a variable from models(CPC) table
- weight - weigh6t from models table (default 1000, because prices are bidded at the CPM rate)


### Saving events ###
Every event is saved to a repository of events. If necessary, a backup of the repository can be made. Saving events do not block futher processing. The repository which stores events is made of txt files.
